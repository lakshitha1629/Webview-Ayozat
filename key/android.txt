Here’s how to generate and register a new upload key:

Follow the instructions in the Android Studio Help Center to generate a new key. It must be different from any previous keys. Alternatively, you can use the following command line to generate a new key:
keytool -genkeypair -alias upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 9125 -keystore keystore.jks

This key must be a 2048 bit RSA key and have 25-year validity.
Export the certificate for that key to PEM format:
keytool -export -rfc -alias upload -file upload_certificate.pem -keystore keystore.jks 

Once you have generated a pem file please follow the steps below: 
Go to Setup > App integrity > App Signing
Request Upload key reset
Give a reason on why you are requesting a key reset
Enters PEM file
Clicks “request”
